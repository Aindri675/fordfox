    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ford Fox and I come from Tabubil, a vibrant town in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea. I was born on February 6, 2002, and have always been driven by a strong sense of purpose and faith. From an early age, I discovered that hard work and humility could open doors to great opportunities. My educational journey began in 2011 and I proudly completed Grade 12 in 2023. I am now an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Management at IBS University. This academic path allows me to explore my interests in leadership, entrepreneurship, and community development. I consider education to be a powerful tool for transformation and social impact. Through my studies and extracurricular activities, I have cultivated skills in communication, planning, and teamwork. I am passionate about leading others with integrity, empathy, and vision. I enjoy organizing events that empower students and bring people together. My involvement in the 2024 Management Fest and Financial Literacy Workshop has helped me grow as a young leader. I am also creative and artisticâ€”I love drawing, designing, and presenting ideas visually. My ambition is to one day lead my own business and use it to improve lives across Papua New Guinea. Outside of school, I enjoy reading motivational books, playing sports, and networking with like-minded youth. I believe that young people have the potential to drive change in society if given the right tools and mindset. Faith plays a central role in my life, and I always strive to put God first in all that I do. I value integrity, respect, and discipline as the foundation of personal and professional growth. I am committed to continuously learning, growing, and lifting others up along the way. My long-term goal is to become a leader who builds businesses that are ethical, inclusive, and impactful. I am determined to rise above challenges and leave a legacy that inspires others to do the same.</p>
